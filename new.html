         SEER: 'SEER is the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. Central air conditioners are rated according to their seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). SEER indicates the relative amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Many older systems have SEER ratings of 6 or less. The minimum SEER allowed today is 13. Look for the ENERGY STAR&reg; label for central air conditioners with SEER ratings of 13 or greater, but consider using air conditioning equipment with higher SEER ratings for greater energy savings.',
         AFUE: 'AFUE stands for Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency. Specifically, AFUE is the ratio of annual heat output of the furnace or boiler compared to the total annual fossil fuel energy consumed by a furnace or boiler. An AFUE of 90% means that 90% of the energy in the fuel becomes heat for the home and the other 10% escapes up the chimney and elsewhere. AFUE doesn\'t include the heat losses of the duct system or piping, which can be as much as 35% of the energy for output of the furnace when ducts are located in the attic, garage, or other partially conditioned or unconditioned space. When choosing a furnace system, the higher the AFUE rating the better.',
         HSPF: 'HSPF stands for Heating Seasonal Performance Factor. Similar to SEER and AFUE, a higher HSPF rating corresponds to greater efficiency. This translates into greater energy savings.',
         HVAC: 'HVAC stands for Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning.'

                           <p>Versatile heating and cooling power in an efficient unit: Westinghouse heat pumps. Homeowners residing in areas where temperatures are mild may want to explore a Westinghouse heat pump system. A heat pump is able to switch between heating and cooling settings in order to keep temperatures comfortable year-round. Like other Westinghouse products, heat pumps are factory checked 144 times before leaving the manufacturing plant in order to maintain high quality standards and live up to our quality pledge to consumers.<br><br>The processes that go into constructing a Westinghouse heat pump are aimed at providing an efficient, durable <a rel="popover">HVAC</a> unit. For example, the louvered metal jacket with the 950-hour salt spray finish resists corrosion 50% better than standard finishes.</p>
