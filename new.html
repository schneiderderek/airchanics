                  <h3>Amana</h3>
                  <p>Don&#39;t risk the loss of indoor comfort of your home. For long-lasting performance, we suggest you choose an Amana&reg; brand central air conditioning system in your home. Keep your home cool, lower your energy costs, and enjoy our best limited warranty protection for peace of mind. </p>

                  <h3>Goodman</h3>
                  <p>The Goodman brand has a central air conditioning system that is perfect for your home - at a refreshingly affordable price. Even on the hottest days of the year, you can keep your home cool and comfortable while enjoying low energy costs with a high-efficiency Goodman brand air conditioner. Don't choose between affordability, durability, and optimum cooling comfort. Install a Goodman brand air conditioner and get all three - and what we believe to be the best warranty protection in the heating and cooling industry. As you review the various Goodman brand air conditioners, remember that higher SEER numbers reflect the most energy-efficient systems.
                  <br><br>
                  All Goodman brand air conditioners come with outstanding warranty coverage. </p>

                  <h3>Westinghouse</h3>
                  <p>Durability and peace of mind are two things homeowners can expect from a Westinghouse air conditioner. By employing the latest innovations in craftsmanship and materials, a Westinghouse air conditioning unit is an industry leader. The iQ Drive® line of products can be rated all the way up to 25.5 SEER. Additionally, this wide range of products offers low noise levels and energy savings through compressor modulation; a process in which your air conditioner does not have to go through as many on/off cycles.
                  <br><br>
                  Furthermore, premium Westinghouse air conditioners are backed by a 10-year long parts warranty. This limited parts warranty covers any new part needed due to manufacturing defects. However, for additional insurance, homeowners can purchase the Contractors’ Preferred Protection Plan. If offered by your local contractor, this can cover the cost of labor during a system repair.</p>

                  <h3>Goodman</h3>
                  <p>Goodman brand gas furnaces can deliver warm, money-saving indoor comfort year after year to your home. Variable and multi-speed furnaces can provide enhanced indoor comfort by slowly ramping up to your thermostat setting rather than simply turning on at full speed.

Choose from a full line of Goodman brand gas furnaces that we believe offer the best warranty protection in the heating and cooling industry. To find a gas furnace that delivers maximum energy efficiency and savings, select a unit with the highest AFUE rating.</p>
