               <img alt="Image Cannot be Loaded" src="heat-pump.jpg" class="img-responsive">
               <p>Many homeowners can help the environment and save significantly on energy bills by installing a Heat Pump. A Heat Pump replaces conventional air conditioning and can also supply heat in the winter. It may not seem that in winter there's much outdoor heat to draw from. But at temperatures above 25 - 30 degree range , Heat Pumps are very efficient at squeezing heat from outdoor air. In this way, Heat Pumps both cools your home and heats it. And in many cases, they do so more efficiently than a conventional heating and air system. Please contact us today for more information.</p>

               <img alt="Image Cannot be Loaded" src="boiler.gif" class="img-responsive">
               <p>Your business or home's boiler is the core of your hydroponic heating system. If your boiler is in need of repair or service we can help. When it comes to boilers, regular checks and maintenance are essential to the life and operation of your equipment. Boilers that aren't kept in full 100% working order can continue to heat your home, but they may waste energy, and your hard-earned money if they're not repaired or maintained. A mid-winter breakdown could be extremely costly and inconvenient. The best way to guard against such inconvenient emergencies is with regular service and maintenance.

               <h4>Humidifiers</h4>
               <img alt="Image Cannot be Loaded" src="humidifier.jpg" class="img-responsive">
               <p>If the air in your home is very dry, below 30% relative humidity, your family can become uncomfortable. Dry air can cause nosebleeds and infections, asthma may be aggravated, and skin can dry out so that it chaps. Dry air in the home can parch and crack wood paneling, furniture and musical instruments. Whole house humidifiers add life-giving moisture to the interior of your home, giving you softer, younger skin, protection for your woodwork and a more comfortable and healthful environment. In the winter, a humidifier can also save energy and money as humid air feels warmer at the same furnace setting. Please contact us today about our whole house humidifiers.</p>

               <p>Do you want to breathe cleaner, fresher air? Adding state-of-the-art filters to a heating and air system can remove high percentages of dangerous particles, such as: dust, pet dander (small scales from fur, skin or feathers), dust mites (microscopic spiders that live in dust), mold, and other micro-organisms. According to the American Lung Association, an air purification system can provide additional protection for any family as well as sensitive individuals.</p>

               <h4>Duct Inspection and Sealing</h4>
               <img alt="Image Cannot be Loaded" src="duct-sealing.jpg" class="img-responsive">
               <p>Sealing air ducts in your home is a step that can save you both energy and money. Often the joints in the duct system are sealed with duct tape. While duct tape is an extremely useful product, it is only a temporary measure when it comes to sealing ducts! Permanent sealing requires painting with a mastic, a thick, gooey substance. When ducts are properly insulated, you can save even more money on energy bills. Ducts can leak as much as 25% of their cargo of air that has been warmed or cooled. In addition, air contaminated with undesirable particles can leak into your ducts from the attic, crawl space or basement. Duct inspection, permanent sealing and insulation of the ducts are recommended as key energy-saving steps by organizations such as the Alliance to Save Energy. We start by inspecting your ducts or if it is already leaking, we recommend sealing with mastic. We can also advise you as to whether additional insulation of your ducts for further energy and cost savings is desirable.
